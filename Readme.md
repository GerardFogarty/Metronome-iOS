## iOS Metronome app

The idea for this app was born from an experience I had: I was turning on my PC just for a browser-based metronome I like to use when I thought how it would be so much handier to have an actual metronome. I got thinking about what a metronome actually does and realised it could be made into an app fairly easily without compromising the usability of a real metronome. In fact it could be more suited to being an app rather than a dedicated device, as the possibilities and potential features are much more varied.

In the near future I hope to polish the app to a level suitable for the App Store. I think there are still a few visual rough edges that could be sharpened up but as it stands the functionality works well. 

This app uses [PureData](https://puredata.info/) ( [libpd](http://libpd.cc/about/) specifically) to synthesize audio on the fly.
